## 🧠 About Me

I am an AI Developer specializing in Generative AI, Large Language Models, and Natural Language Processing. Currently pursuing an M.Tech in Artificial Intelligence, I have hands-on experience building LLM-powered applications, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, and end-to-end machine learning pipelines through internships and applied projects. My work includes document intelligence, vector-based semantic search, sales prediction, NLP automation, and interactive AI dashboards using Python, Hugging Face, Pinecone, Streamlit, and cloud platforms. I enjoy translating complex data and business requirements into scalable, real-world AI solutions and continuously improving model performance through experimentation and evaluation. I am open to collaborating on impactful AI/GenAI projects and professional opportunities.
